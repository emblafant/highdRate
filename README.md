# HighdRate - Water Tracking Mobile App

HighdRate is a mobile app that helps you track your daily water intake and reminds you to drink more water throughout the day. With HighdRate, you can easily set a daily water intake goal and log your water intake with just a few taps. You can also get reminders to drink more water throughout the day.

This is my first time using React Native, and this project was developed as a learning experience to gain familiarity with the framework and its features.

## Usage

HighdRate is a mobile app designed to help you track your daily water intake and stay hydrated throughout the day. Here's how you can use the app:

1. Upon launching the app, you'll see a dashboard that shows your current water intake for the day and your progress towards your daily water goal. Additionally, there is a countdown clock that turns red towards the end of the day if the daily intake has not been reached, helping you stay on track with your hydration goals.

2. You can change your water goal under water settings. You have the option to enter it manually or calculate it based on personal information such as weight and activity level. Additionally, you can customize the size and measurement units for your water goal.

3. To log your water intake, tap on the "+" button on the start screen, and the app will update your total water intake for the day.

4. The app features a streak system that can be enabled or disabled. Additionally, you can enable notifications to be sent out at 22:00 every day to remind you to drink water.

5. The app allows users to set their own custom reminder notifications to prompt them to drink water throughout the day. These reminders can be toggled on or off in the Notifications section of the app. Users can also delete existing reminders by long-pressing on them in the reminder list.

6. The user can enter personal information such as their name, weight, daily activity, diet, and climate. This information is used to calculate their recommended daily water intake, which can be set as their daily water goal in the app's settings.

7. There is a toggle for high contrast mode that changes the app's colors to have higher contrast, making it easier to use for those with visual impairments or bad eyesight. This feature can be toggled on or off from the settings screen.

8. In the app, you'll find a dedicated screen with important information about water intake. Here, you'll find links to resources that can help you learn more about staying hydrated, as well as information about the recommended daily water intake based on your age, gender, weight, and activity level. It's important to note that everyone's needs may differ, and some individuals may need to manually adjust their water intake based on their doctor's recommendations, especially if they have a medical condition. Additionally, the screen provides important warnings about the dangers of overhydration and the importance of consulting with a medical professional before making any changes to your water intake regimen.
That's it! With HighdRate, you can easily track your water intake and stay hydrated throughout the day. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to us through the app or on our GitHub repository.
